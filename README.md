## My Experience

Building this project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
- DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Using localStorage for persistent data
- Handling real-time features like reminders and auto-deletion
- Designing a clean, user-friendly interface with CSS

I enjoyed implementing features like undo for deleted tasks and automatic reminder alerts. This project gave me hands-on experience with practical web development tasks and improved my confidence in building interactive browser apps.
